&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm Drew, I'm just a guy who likes gaming and
programming. I'm 18 years old and I currently attend Highschool at <a href="https://www.shortridgeacademy.com/" target="_blank">Shortridge Academy</a> but I previously attended Highschool at <a href="http://www2.fcps.edu/RobinsonSS/" target="_blank">Robinson Secondary School.</a>
I've been playing video games since I was 10 and I've always loved
them. In 2012 when I was 14 years old, I got really into programming
when I tried to develop Modifications (Mods) for Minecraft. I started
to teach myself but I realized I wasn't going to get very far so I
decided to attend camps and take programming classes in school to help
me. I first learned Java and I really enjoyed it. Then in highschool I
took classes to learn how to program and make videogames. I started
learning basic programs such as Alice and Visual Basic. I excelled
through those programs and the next year I moved up to the next level.
I continued with Visual Basic but went more in depth with it.&nbsp; In
the summer between my 10th and 11th grades of Highschool I was a
Program Assistant at <a href="http://www.computercamps.com/" target="_blank">Emagination Comuputer Camps</a>,
I had a lot of fun and I enjoyed getting to teach and help out kids who
wanted to become programmers. I also recieved a letter of recommendation from them, download it <a target="_blank" href="A.Morriss_PA%20Reference%20letter_PW%2011-8-16.pdf">HERE</a>.
Then for my third year of taking
programming in Highschool I learned Unity. Unity fun but also a little
challenging but that made it all the more worth. Towards the end of my
11th grade year at Robinson I was sent to a Wilderness Rehab Program to
work on my Depression and Anxiety. After the Wilderness Rehab I was
sent to Shortridge Academy. I've been working on getting better and
learning how to deal with my issues. I've made a lot of progress and I
hope to get a lot better by the time I go to college. <br>
